Welcome to technical documentation of the ITS-FMS Interface
===================================

With ITS services, truck drivers can get in-truck real-time information about dangerous situations, speed limits, lane closures, events, closed bridges, emergency vehicles approaching, tyre pressure measurements, information of smart traffic lights and many other types of real-time traffic information. 
ITS services are the collective name for the available smart applications that can be used in-truck.

The use of these kinds of data leads to benefits for logistics companies, governments and society with regard to traffic flow, traffic flow, livability, sustainability and the environment.

A standardized interface between logistics parties and ITS cloud service providers has been realized. This so-called ITS-FMS interface makes it possible to make ITS services part of the solutions of a logistics IT-supplier (typically Fleet Management System suppliers). The ITS-FMS interface has been established as an OTM profile, for which this page provides an introduction to start using ITS services.
